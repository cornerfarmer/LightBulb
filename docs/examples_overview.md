# Examples

A few examples which explain how LightBulb should be used.

## Backpropagation xor:

A first basic example how to train a neural network to simulate a xor calculator. To achieve that a simple gradient descent algorithm is used.

## Function evolution:

A simple example how to use evolution in LightBulb. Our goal is to find the global minimum of the [six-hump camel-back function](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/camel6.html).
